### Miners
GPU: 1x80 GB or 2x24GB or 1x48GB

Storage: 200Gb

RAM: 32Gb


Note: That's not to say you can't use other GPU's!

## Setup steps

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namoray/vision
cd vision
```

### Install system dependencies

If you are in a container such as runpod, run these:

```bash
### Install pm2 & jq
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install nodejs npm -y
npm i -g pm2
apt-get install -y jq

### Install nano so you can edit the config easily
apt-get update
apt-get install nano
```

If you are on a bare metal machine (e.g. Vast) where you require `sudo`, use the following:
```bash
### Install pm2 & jq
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
sudo npm i -g pm2
sudo apt-get install -y jq

### Install nano so you can edit the config easily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nano
```

### Install python dependencies
Make sure you have installed the correct python version, and then follow these steps:

```bash
### Install the local python environment
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
pip install -r git_requirements.txt
```

If for some reason that doesn't work, you may need to use `pip3`;
```bash
### Install the local python environment
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install -r git_requirements.txt
```

### Download the necessary models
Simple step this one - note it may take a while if you have poor bandwidth (not recommended)

```bash
./get_models.sh
```

### Define the configuration for your miners to run
Since you have already installed vision (with `pip install -e .`), you can now use the Vision cli to define the configuration you want.

I'd recommend sdxl turbo & kandinsky being on separate GPU's, as they take a lot of vram (unless you have 80gb+)
```bash
vision create-config
```

This will automagically spit out a config.yaml file with all your preferences. You can use
```bash
nano config.yaml
```
at any time to edit it, or `cat config.yaml` to view it! (If you didn't install nano, you can try `nano config.yaml`)

It will also create a start_miners.sh script to automatically run the miners according the config you generated.

**If you change the config.yaml, you will also need to edit the start_miners.sh script to reflect this!**

### Start miners

**Autoupdates**

Autoupdates will reinstall dependencies and rerun ./start_miners.sh when a new tag is introduced.

Announcements will still be made ahead of time. If you choose to run autoupdates as a miner, make sure your ./start_miners.sh
script is up to date & working, and I would advise monitoring around update releases regardless.

If there is a model change with an update, you will need manual intervention (this will be made clear before each update though)

You're of course free to change or use whatever autoupdater you like!

```bash
pm2 start --name run_miner_auto_update "python run_miner_auto_update.py"
```

**No autoupdates**

You can either use the command
```bash
./start_miners.sh
```


Or you can use the usual pm2 commands
```bash
pm2 start --name NAME_FOR_MINER_HERE mining/run_miner.py --interpreter python3 -- --axon.port YOUR_AXON_PORT --axon.external_ip EXTERNAL_IP_FOR_AXON --wallet.name WALLET_NAME --wallet.hotkey WALLET_HOTKEY --subtensor.network SUBTENSOR_NETWORK --netuid 19 --logging.debug
```

**NOTE**
If you want to run multiple miners on the same machine, I would advise just running one of the pm2 commands first from ./start_miners.sh - else you will download models multiple times!
